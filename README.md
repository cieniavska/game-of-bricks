# game-of-bricks

A 2D game "Tile classics" written in vanilla JavaScript for HTML 5 Canvas.

The code was written while taking a course on Udemy called "How to program games" created by Chris DeLeon, game developer educator. 

The code belongs to Chris, I have only made some improvements, meaning I've updated the code to a newer standard of JS. That means that you can find there arrow functions, lets and consts instead of vars, different names of variables (camel Case).

Enjoy!
